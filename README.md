# DonkeyKong-ish
A game based on the legendary Donkey Kong.

This was a game I originally wrote in Java; my then 9 year old son designed the levels. Sorry I can't remember where I got the sprites, other elements were drawn by my son. I've ported it over to the Wii U. I got the music from [Donkey Kong Soundboard](https://www.101soundboards.com/boards/10758-donkey-kong-soundboard). 

Hope you like it. It gets harder the second time round.

The game makes use of osscreen and sndcore2 code I developed for previous games, see [PacMan-ish Wiki](https://github.com/MartinButlerAAA/PacMan-ishU/wiki) and [Connect4U](https://github.com/MartinButlerAAA/Connect4U).
